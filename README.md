# Capstone

## For Development

There are two folders in this project.
- `client` has the code to run the ReactJS App
- `server` has the code to run the ExpressJS App

If you are only working one of these apps at a time, you can `cd` into that directory and run `npm run dev`

If you are working on both of these apps at the same time you will need to ensure that both of the apps are running.
